 2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

   Ojects are nothing but colleciton of key value pair.
     
       syntax:
                  
             var <object-name>={key1:value1,
                                key2:value2,...
                                .........
                                keyN:valueN}


   Objects, in JavaScript, it is most important data-type and forms the building blocks 
for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript's primitive 
data-types(Number,String,Boolean,null,undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these
primitive data-types all store a single value each.

  var car="Mercedes"; objects are varibale too.But objects can contain many values.

    var car= {make:"mercedes",
              model:"c-class",
              color:"white",
              fuel:"diesel"}
